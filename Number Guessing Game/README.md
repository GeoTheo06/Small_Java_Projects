numberGuessingGame.java is one of the projects i really liked and played sometimes i was bored. 

The concept is simple: at the beginning, you select the dfficulty. The more difficult difficulty you select, the more the generated number will grow up and the tries you havewill shrink. Then, you have a limited amount of guesses, you can use to guess the correct number.
